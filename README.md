# Awesome Claude Code Hooks [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated collection of Claude Code hooks — event-driven automations that trigger before or after Claude Code actions.

Hooks are shell commands that run automatically when Claude Code performs specific actions. They're defined in `settings.json` and trigger on events like `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `Stop`, and more.
